the answer 
==============================


I don't pretend to not have the right answer
Never said I held the key
But somehow they see a light inside of them
Am I not the man who I was meant to be?

As the people gather around me
I never felt so all strong
Is this the chance to be someone?
My moment in the sun
Why am I afraid of facing them?

They are finding faith in me and they believe I'm the one to set them free
