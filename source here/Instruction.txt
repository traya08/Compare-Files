				Compare Files

====================================================================
## This code is represented by a function named "comparison_file" ##

- you could run the script by double clicking on it or by calling it from the CMD 
after navigating to its directory

- the script shows the result of comparison in a window on your screen
if you want the result to be stored in a text file, you have simply to remove the 
msgbox and add in the last for loop the next : objXXX.writeline strNotCurrent

NB : before the for loop, you have to create the file first

Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set objXXX = objFSO.CreateTextFile("C:\your_path\xxx.txt",TRUE)

- when you run the script, an input box will pop up to ask you for the name of the files 

if your files are stored in the same directory as the script, you could only provide their 
names followed by thier nature (.txt, .c, etc.) like hello_world.txt
if not, you provide the full path of each file like C:\your_path\xxx.txt

- the files provided represent a song by dream theatre
file1 contain the right song lyrics
